#Computational Text Analysis Workshop
##About

This is the repository for the Computational Text Analysis Workshop at the 2016 Digital Humanities @ Berkeley Summer Institute.

Scholars across multiple disciplines are finding themselves face-to-face with massive amounts of digitized data. In the humanities and many social science disciplines, this data is often in the form of unstructured text. This course will introduce students to cutting edge ways of structuring and analyzing digitized text-as-data, and will do so by exploring questions fundamental to the humanities. The ultimate goal is to encourage students to think about novel ways they can apply these techniques to their own data and research questions, and to provide the skills necessary to apply the methods in their own research. We will use the open source (and free!) programming language Python.

##Topics Covered

Working with texts in Python<br />
Structuring unstructured text<br />
NLTK and NLP<br />
Discriminating Words<br />
Dictionary Methods<br />
The Vector Space Model and the Geometry of Text (Multi-dimensional Scaling, Most Similar Texts, Clustering)<br />
Topic Models<br />
Quantifying Style: Grammar, Alliteration, and other Poetic Concerns<br />

##Requirements

This workship will be taught in the open source programming language Python. Participants should install [anaconda for Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads]) on their laptops prior to the first class.

    "## Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python's NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most frequent tasks in computational text analysis is quickly summarizing the content of text. In this lesson we will learn two ways of summarzing text using Python's nltk, and in the process learn some quick and easy NLP techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is an umbrella term that incorporates many techiques and methods to process, analyze, and understand natural languages (as opposed to artificial languages like logics, or Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to jump right in to text analysis and natural language processing. Rather than starting with the nitty gritty of programming in Python, this lesson will demonstrate some neat things you can do with a minimal amount of coding and will give you an understanding of why you may want to learn the nitty gritty. An additional goal of this lesson is to start to get you thinking about analyzing texts via computational methods.  <br /> <br />  By the end of the lesson you will learn how to quickly summarize a text via counting the most frequent words, nouns, and verbs. More specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gain an intuition about how computers process text, and how this is different than how humans read it\n",
    "* Learn some of the basic functions in the nltk package, such as tokenizing texts and part-of-speech tagging, and learn why these might help researchers analyze text\n",
    "* Get started with some basic coding (although don't worry if you don't understand everything)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Outline:\n",
    "- Assigning Text as Variables in Python\n",
    "- Tokenizing Text and Counting Words\n",
    "- Pre-Processing: \n",
    "    * Changing words to lowercase\n",
    "    * Removing stop words\n",
    "    * Removing punctuation\n",
    "- Part-of-Speech Tagging\n",
    "    * Tagging tokens\n",

    "### Key Jargon:\n",
    "* *coding or programming*: \n",
    "    * The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will enable a computer to perform a specific task or solve a given problem. It involves writing those instructions in a specific *programming language*, in our case, Python.\n",
    "* *script*:\n",
    "    * A block of executable code, typically saved in a executable file. For example, script1.py\n",
    "* *packages and modules*: \n",
    "    * Python files, or collections of files, that implement a set of pre-made functions (so we don't have to write all of the functions ourselves). To utilize a module we use the import function.\n",
    "* *parse*: \n",
    "    * the process of analysing a string of symbols, in this case the symbols that make up natural language. This can also include understanding, or parsing, computer code.\n",
    "* *variable*: \n",
    "    * A variable is something that holds a value that may change. In simplest terms, a variable is just a box that you can put stuff in. You can use variables to store all kinds of stuff, including numbers and letters.\n",
    "* *assigning a variable*: \n",
    "    * telling Python what you want to name the variable, and what is stored in the variable.\n",
    "* *string*: \n",
    "    * a type of variable the consists of a sequence of characters in a particular order. Characters can be anything, including letters or numbers. The order of a string is fixed.\n",
    "* *list*: \n",
    "    * a type of variable that consists of a sequence of elements. The order is fixed.\n",
    "* *stop words*: \n",
    "    * the most common words in a language.\n",

What further questions could we ask or analyses could we do to explore this contention further?"
